I have amassed several years of teaching experience alongside full-time tech jobs. Feel free to check out my files here. If you use anything for your own teaching, I would appreciate you citing your sources!

## Experience

  * taught stats/programming to scientists & supported their preparation of technical manuscripts and grant applications
  * ðŸš™ see the Tanzania folder for a somewhat humorous presentation I made with the intent of demonstrating non-standard methods of visualizing data

I regularly guide colleagues in using `git`/GitHub, writing clear & concise SQL queries, and setting up software (EC2 instances, Data Grip, R/Python environments, `ssh` aliases, etc.).
