I have amassed several years of teaching experience alongside full-time tech jobs. Feel free to peruse my files here. If you use anything for your own teaching, I would appreciate you citing your sources!

## Experience
I co-authored [an introductory Python textbook](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/introduction-to-python-programming-for-business-and-social-science-applications/book268933), which was published in August 2020.

My teaching experience, with some details not found on my resume:
* **Fall 2022 & Fall 2023**: Python Crash Courses at [Plymouth Library](https://www.hclib.org/about/locations/plymouth) ðŸ“š
  * Actively brainstorming plans for 2024 and beyond.
* **Mayâ€“September 2021**: Adjunct Instructor at Southern New Hampshire University
  * First cohort of SNHU's MS of Business Analytics Program
  * Entirely online
* **August 2018â€“February 2019** and **November 2019â€“May 2020**: Instructor for two Trilogy Analytics Bootcamps
  * mostly in person; pivoted to online due to the COVID-19 pandemic
  * ðŸ¤“ I contributed several PRs to the curriculum, and received positive feedback from curriculum engineers.
* **Julyâ€“December 2015**: English Teaching Fellow at the [Ifakara Health Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifakara_Health_Institute) in Tanzania ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¿
  * taught stats/programming to scientists & supported their preparation of technical manuscripts and grant applications
  * ðŸš™ see [the Tanzania folder](https://github.com/paulkaefer/Teaching_Portfolio/tree/main/Tanzania) for a somewhat humorous presentation I made with the intent of demonstrating non-standard methods of visualizing data

I regularly guide colleagues in using `git`/GitHub, writing clear & concise SQL queries, and setting up software (EC2 instances, Data Grip, R/Python environments, `ssh` aliases, etc.).

## Conference Participation
I have presented at several conferences. Highlights include the 2018 SAS Global Forum and the 2013 IEEE robotics conference. See my [`Publications/`](https://github.com/paulkaefer/Teaching_Portfolio/tree/main/Publications) and [`Photos/`](https://github.com/paulkaefer/Teaching_Portfolio/tree/main/Photos) folders for a sample of relevant files, and additional details at [paulkaefer.com/publications](https://paulkaefer.com/publications/).

<!-- future idea: ## Philosophy -- mention sharing resources, collaboration, culture of learning, inclusion/DEI, meeting people where they are at, encouraging being curious -->
